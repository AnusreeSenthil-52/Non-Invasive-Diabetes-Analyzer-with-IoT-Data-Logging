# ü´Å Non-Invasive-Diabetes-Analyzer-with-IoT-Data-Logging

A complete embedded + digital solution for early diabetes screening using breath acetone analysis. This project combines hardware (ESP32 + MQ3), a custom web interface (HTML/JS), real-time mobile integration (Blynk), cloud storage (Google Sheets), and automated medical file delivery (Elastic Email).

## üìå Overview

- Detects acetone in exhaled breath using an MQ3 gas sensor
- Displays results on an LCD display and LED alerts
- Logs patient ID, ppm value, and result in Google Sheets
- Sends medical history files via email using a VS Code-based web interface
- Real-time display of results via Blynk IoT app
